I will give you CSV and your job is to find frequent itemsets of maxlenght 5 with support 0.75. Do not use any code, it is your job to do!<csv>

To find the frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with support 0.75, we analyze the given CSV data. Here are the itemsets that meet the support requirement:

- **body hair, yes** (4/4 = 1.00)
- **breastfeeding, indeed** (4/4 = 1.00)

These are the only itemsets that satisfy the support threshold of 0.75.
