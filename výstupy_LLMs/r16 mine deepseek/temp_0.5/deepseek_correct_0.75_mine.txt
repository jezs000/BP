I will give you CSV and your job is to find frequent itemsets of maxlenght 5 with support 0.75. Do not use any code, it is your job to do!<csv>

Okay, I need to find frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with a support of 0.75. The dataset is small, so I'll go through it step by step.

First, I'll list all the attributes and their possible values:
- name: human, rabbit, platypus, fox
- legs count: 2, 4
- diet: carnivore, herbivore, omnivore
- blood: yes, hot
- body hair: yes, no (since False means no)
- eggs: True, False
- breastfeeding: indeed, no (since False means not breastfeeding)

Now, I'll calculate the support for each individual item.

For name:
- human: appears once → support = 1/4 = 0.25 (not frequent)
- rabbit: appears once → same as above
- platypus: appears once → same
- fox: appears once → same

For legs count:
- 2: appears once → support 0.25
- 4: appears 3 times → support 0.75 (frequent)

Diet:
- carnivore: appears once → 0.25
- herbivore: appears once → 0.25
- omnivore: appears 2 times → support 0.5 (not frequent)

Blood:
- yes: appears 3 times → 0.75 (frequent)
- hot: appears once → 0.25

Body hair:
- yes: appears 3 times → 0.75 (frequent)
- no: appears once → 0.25

Eggs:
- True: appears once → 0.25
- False: appears 3 times → 0.75 (frequent)

Breastfeeding:
- indeed: appears 3 times → 0.75 (frequent)
- no: appears once → 0.25

Now, I'll list all the frequent individual items:
- legs count 4
- diet omnivore, herbivore, carnivore (none frequent)
- blood yes
- body hair yes
- eggs False
- breastfeeding indeed

Next, I'll move to itemsets of length 2.

I'll check each pair to see if both items are frequent in the same transaction.

Starting with legs count 4 and blood yes:
- Both appear together in 3 out of 4 transactions → support 0.75 (frequent)
Itemset: legs count 4, blood yes

legs count 4 and body hair yes:
- Both appear together in 3 transactions → support 0.75 (frequent)
Itemset: legs count 4, body hair yes

legs count 4 and eggs False:
- Both appear together in 3 transactions → support 0.75 (frequent)
Itemset: legs count 4, eggs False

legs count 4 and breastfeeding indeed:
- Both appear together in 3 transactions → support 0.75 (frequent)
Itemset: legs count 4, breastfeeding indeed

legs count 4 with diet omnivore:
- Only appears once → support 0.25 (not frequent)

legs count 4 with diet herbivore:
- Only once → not frequent

legs count 4 with diet carnivore:
- Only once → not frequent

legs count 4 with diet omnivore is not frequent, so no need to consider further.

Now, blood yes with body hair yes:
- Both appear together in 1 transaction (platypus) → support 0.25 (not frequent)

Blood yes with eggs False:
- Both appear together in 2 transactions (rabbit, human) → support 0.5 (not frequent)

Blood yes with breastfeeding indeed:
- Both appear together in 1 transaction (rabbit) → support 0.25 (not frequent)

Body hair yes with eggs False:
- Both appear together in 1 transaction (rabbit) → support 0.25 (not frequent)

Body hair yes with breastfeeding indeed:
- Both appear together in 1 transaction (rabbit) → support 0.25 (not frequent)

Eggs False with breastfeeding indeed:
- Both appear together in 1 transaction (rabbit) → support 0.25 (not frequent)

legs count 4 with diet herbivore, carnivore is not frequent, so no further combinations.

Now, I'll check other pairs among the frequent single items that haven't been checked yet.

Diet omnivore with blood yes:
- Only in 2 transactions → support 0.5 (not frequent)

Diet omnivore with body hair yes:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

Diet omnivore with eggs False:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

Diet omnivore with breastfeeding indeed:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

Similarly, herbivore and carnivore with any other frequent item are not frequent.

Now, moving to itemsets of length 3.

I'll check combinations of three items.

legs count 4, blood yes, body hair yes:
- Only in 1 transaction → support 0.25 (not frequent)

legs count 4, blood yes, eggs False:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

legs count 4, blood yes, breastfeeding indeed:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

legs count 4, body hair yes, eggs False:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

legs count 4, body hair yes, breastfeeding indeed:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

legs count 4, eggs False, breastfeeding indeed:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

legs count 4, diet herbivore, anything else: not frequent

legs count 4, diet carnivore, anything else: not frequent

Now, checking combinations that don't include legs count 4.

blood yes, body hair yes, eggs False:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

blood yes, body hair yes, breastfeeding indeed:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

Similarly, other combinations of three without legs count 4 are not frequent.

Next, itemsets of length 4.

legs count 4, blood yes, body hair yes, eggs False:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

legs count 4, blood yes, body hair yes, breastfeeding indeed:
- Only in 1 transaction → 0.25 (not frequent)

Other combinations of four without legs count 4 are not frequent.

Finally, the only possible 5-length itemset would include legs count 4 with all four frequent single items, but support would be only 1/4 = 0.25, which is below 0.75.

So, there are no frequent itemsets of length 5.

After checking all possible combinations, the only frequent itemsets are those involving legs count 4 with any single frequent item, and no combinations of two, three, or four frequent items meet the support threshold.

### Frequent Itemsets with Support ≥ 0.75

#### Length 1:
- legs count 4

#### Length 2:
- legs count 4, blood yes
- legs count 4, body hair yes
- legs count 4, eggs False
- legs count 4, breastfeeding indeed

#### Length 3:
No frequent itemsets.

#### Length 4:
No frequent itemsets.

#### Length 5:
No frequent itemsets.

### Conclusion

The only frequent itemset is of length 1: legs count 4.
