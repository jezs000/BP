To find frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with support ≥ 0.75, I will analyze the provided CSV data. Each row represents a transaction, and the values are the item identifiers.

### Step 1: List All Possible Itemsets
First, I will list all possible combinations of the 7 unique item identifiers (U1 to U7). Then, I will evaluate their support.

### Step 2: Calculate Support for Each Itemset
Support is calculated as the proportion of transactions containing the itemset.

### Step 3: Filter Itemsets by Support ≥ 0.75
I will retain only those itemsets whose support meets or exceeds 0.75.

### Results

#### Single Itemsets (Length 1)
- U1: 8/9 (88.89%)
- U2: 8/9 (88.89%)
- U3: 5/9 (55.56%)
- U4: 8/9 (88.89%)
- U5: 8/9 (88.89%)
- U6: 5/9 (55.56%)
- U7: 9/9 (100.00%)

#### Itemsets of Length 2
- U1, U2: 5/9 (55.56%)
- U1, U4: 8/9 (88.89%)
- U1, U5: 5/9 (55.56%)
- U2, U4: 7/9 (77.78%)
- U2, U5: 7/9 (77.78%)
- U4, U5: 8/9 (88.89%)
- U4, U7: 9/9 (100.00%)
- U5, U7: 9/9 (100.00%)

#### Itemsets of Length 3
- U1, U2, U4: 5/9 (55.56%)
- U1, U4, U5: 5/9 (55.56%)
- U2, U4, U5: 7/9 (77.78%)
- U2, U5, U7: 7/9 (77.78%)
- U4, U5, U7: 8/9 (88.89%)

#### Itemsets of Length 4
- U1, U2, U4, U5: 5/9 (55.56%)
- U2, U4, U5, U7: 7/9 (77.78%)
- U4, U5, U7: 8/9 (88.89%)

#### Itemsets of Length 5
- U1, U2, U4, U5, U7: 5/9 (55.56%)
- U2, U4, U5, U7: 7/9 (77.78%)

#### Itemsets of Length 6 and 7
- U1, U2, U4, U5, U7: 5/9 (55.56%)
- U2, U4, U5, U7: 7/9 (77.78%)

### Final Answer

After evaluating all possible itemsets and filtering those with support ≥ 0.75, the frequent itemsets are:

1. U1, U2, U4 (55.56%)
2. U1, U4, U5 (55.56%)
3. U2, U4, U5 (77.78%)
4. U4, U5, U7 (88.89%)
5. U1, U2, U4, U5, U7 (55.56%)
6. U2, U4, U5, U7 (77.78%)

### Summary
The frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with support ≥ 0.75 are as listed above.
