I will give you CSV and your job is to find frequent itemsets of maxlenght 5 with support 0.75. Do not use any code, it is your job to do!<csv>

To find the frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with support 0.75, we analyze the given CSV data. The CSV contains the following attributes: name, legs count, diet, blood, body hair, eggs, and breastfeeding.

### Step 1: List All Items and Their Counts
First, we list each item and its frequency in the dataset:

- **name**: rabbit (1), human (1), fox (1), platypus (1)
- **legs count**: 4 (3), 2 (1), 4 (1), 4 (1)
- **diet**: herbivore (2), omnivore (2), carnivore (1)
- **blood**: hot (3), hot (3), hot (3)
- **body hair**: yes (3), yes (3)
- **eggs**: False (3), True (1)
- **breastfeeding**: indeed (3)

### Step 2: Identify Items with Support â‰¥ 0.75
Next, we identify which items meet the support threshold of 0.75 (i.e., appear in at least 4 out of 4 records):

- **legs count**: 4 (3) - **does not meet support**
- **blood**: hot (3) - **does not meet support**
- **body hair**: yes (3) - **does not meet support**

### Step 3: Generate Frequent Itemsets
Since no single item meets the support threshold, we look for itemsets of length 2 or more. However, none of the combinations of two or more items meet the support threshold of 0.75.

### Final Answer
There are no frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with support 0.75 in the given dataset.
