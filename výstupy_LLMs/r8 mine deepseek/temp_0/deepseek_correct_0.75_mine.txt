Alright, so I have this CSV data about animals and I need to find frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with a support of 0.75. Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding what each column represents.

First, "name" is just the animal's name, so I can ignore that for the itemsets. Then, "legs count" has values like 4, 2, 4, and 2. "Diet" can be herbivore or omnivore. "Blood" is either hot or cold, but in the data, it's always hot. "Body hair" is yes or no, and "eggs" is either False or True. "Breastfeeding" is also True or False.

Looking at the data, there are only four unique rows. So each row represents an itemset. Let me list them out:

1. rabbit, 4 legs, herbivore, hot blood, yes body hair, False eggs, indeed breastfeeding
2. human, 2 legs, omnivore, hot blood, yes body hair, False eggs, indeed breastfeeding
3. fox, 4 legs, omnivore, hot blood, yes body hair, False eggs, indeed breastfeeding
4. platypus, 2 legs, carnivore, hot blood, yes body hair, True eggs, indeed breastfeeding

Wait, but "legs count" is 4, 2, 4, 2. So it's either 2 or 4. "Diet" is herbivore for rabbit and human, omnivore for fox and platypus. "Blood" is always hot, so that's the same for all. "Body hair" is yes for all. "Eggs" is False for rabbit, human, and fox; True for platypus. "Breastfeeding" is indeed for rabbit, human, and fox; not for platypus.

Now, I need to find itemsets where the support is at least 0.75. Support is the proportion of transactions (rows) that contain the itemset. Since there are 4 transactions, support threshold is 3 (because 0.75 * 4 = 3).

Let me list all possible itemsets and calculate their support.

Starting with single items:

- "rabbit": appears in 1 transaction. Support = 0.25. Below 0.75.
- "4 legs": appears in 2 (rabbit and fox). Support = 0.5. Below.
- "herbivore": 2 (rabbit and human). Support = 0.5.
- "hot blood": 4. Support = 1.0. Above.
- "yes body hair": 4. Support = 1.0.
- "False eggs": 3 (rabbit, human, fox). Support = 0.75. Exactly.
- "indeed breastfeeding": 3 (all except platypus). Support = 0.75. Exactly.

So single items with support >=0.75 are "hot blood", "yes body hair", "False eggs", and "indeed breastfeeding".

Next, pairs:

Now I'll combine each single item with every other single item to form pairs and check their support.

1. "rabbit" + "4 legs": 1. Support 0.25.
2. "rabbit" + "herbivore": 1. Support 0.25.
3. "rabbit" + "hot blood": 1. Support 0.25.
4. "rabbit" + "yes body hair": 1. Support 0.25.
5. "rabbit" + "False eggs": 1. Support 0.25.
6. "rabbit" + "indeed breastfeeding": 1. Support 0.25.
7. "4 legs" + "herbivore": 1. Support 0.25.
8. "4 legs" + "hot blood": 2. Support 0.5.
9. "4 legs" + "yes body hair": 1. Support 0.25.
10. "4 legs" + "False eggs": 1. Support 0.25.
11. "4 legs" + "indeed breastfeeding": 1. Support 0.25.
12. "herbivore" + "hot blood": 2. Support 0.5.
13. "herbivore" + "yes body hair": 2. Support 0.5.
14. "herbivore" + "False eggs": 1. Support 0.25.
15. "herbivore" + "indeed breastfeeding": 1. Support 0.25.
16. "hot blood" + "yes body hair": 4. Support 1.0.
17. "hot blood" + "False eggs": 2. Support 0.5.
18. "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding": 3. Support 0.75.
19. "yes body hair" + "False eggs": 2. Support 0.5.
20. "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding": 4. Support 1.0.
21. "False eggs" + "indeed breastfeeding": 2. Support 0.5.

From these, pairs with support >=0.75 are:

- "hot blood" + "yes body hair": 4
- "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding": 3
- "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding": 4

Now, moving to triples:

I'll combine each pair with each remaining single item and check support.

1. "hot blood" + "yes body hair" + "False eggs": 2 (only rabbit and fox). Support 0.5.
2. "hot blood" + "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding": 4. Support 1.0.
3. "hot blood" + "yes body hair" + "4 legs": 1. Support 0.25.
4. "hot blood" + "yes body hair" + "herbivore": 2. Support 0.5.
5. "hot blood" + "yes body hair" + "rabbit": 1. Support 0.25.
6. "hot blood" + "yes body hair" + "fox": 1. Support 0.25.
7. "hot blood" + "yes body hair" + "human": 1. Support 0.25.
8. "hot blood" + "yes body hair" + "fox": 1. Support 0.25.
9. "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "False eggs": 1. Support 0.25.
10. "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "4 legs": 2. Support 0.5.
11. "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "herbivore": 1. Support 0.25.
12. "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "rabbit": 1. Support 0.25.
13. "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "fox": 1. Support 0.25.
14. "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "human": 1. Support 0.25.
15. "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "False eggs": 2. Support 0.5.
16. "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "4 legs": 2. Support 0.5.
17. "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "herbivore": 2. Support 0.5.
18. "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "rabbit": 1. Support 0.25.
19. "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "fox": 1. Support 0.25.
20. "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding" + "human": 1. Support 0.25.
21. "hot blood" + "yes body hair" + "False eggs" + "indeed breastfeeding": 1. Support 0.25.

From these, triples with support >=0.75 are:

- "hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding" (support 1.0)
- "hot blood", "indeed breastfeeding", "4 legs" (support 0.5)
- "hot blood", "indeed breastfeeding", "herbivore" (support 0.5)
- "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "herbivore" (support 0.5)
- "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "4 legs" (support 0.5)
- "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "rabbit" (support 0.25)
But wait, I think I missed some. Let's re-examine.

Actually, I think I made a mistake. The triples should be formed by adding one more item to the pairs that had support. The pairs that had support >=0.75 were:

- "hot blood" + "yes body hair"
- "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding"
- "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding"

So now, adding each of these with the remaining single items.

For "hot blood" + "yes body hair":

Adding "False eggs" gives support 2/4=0.5
Adding "4 legs" gives 1/4=0.25
Adding "herbivore" gives 2/4=0.5
Adding "rabbit" gives 1/4=0.25
Adding "fox" gives 1/4=0.25
Adding "human" gives 1/4=0.25

So only "hot blood" + "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding" has support 1.0.

For "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding":

Adding "4 legs" gives 2/4=0.5
Adding "herbivore" gives 2/4=0.5
Adding "rabbit" gives 1/4=0.25
Adding "fox" gives 1/4=0.25
Adding "human" gives 1/4=0.25

So "hot blood", "indeed breastfeeding", and any other single item only have support 0.5, which is below 0.75.

For "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding":

Adding "4 legs" gives 2/4=0.5
Adding "herbivore" gives 2/4=0.5
Adding "rabbit" gives 1/4=0.25
Adding "fox" gives 1/4=0.25
Adding "human" gives 1/4=0.25

Again, no triples here meet the support.

So the only triple with support >=0.75 is "hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding".

Now, moving to quadruples:

Take the triple with support, which is "hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", and add each remaining single item.

Adding "4 legs": The itemset is "hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "4 legs". Support is 1 (rabbit only). Support 0.25 <0.75.

Adding "herbivore": Support is 1 (rabbit only). 0.25 <0.75.

Adding "False eggs": Support is 1 (rabbit only). 0.25 <0.75.

Adding "4 legs", "herbivore", "False eggs" all give support 0.25.

So no quadruple itemsets meet the support.

Finally, the maximum length is 5, but we have only four items, so no 5-length itemsets.

So the frequent itemsets are:

- "hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding" (support 1.0)
- "hot blood", "indeed breastfeeding", "False eggs" (support 2/4=0.5)
- "hot blood", "indeed breastfeeding", "4 legs" (support 2/4=0.5)
- "hot blood", "indeed breastfeeding", "herbivore" (support 2/4=0.5)
- "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "4 legs" (support 2/4=0.5)
- "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "herbivore" (support 2/4=0.5)
- "hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "False eggs" (support 1/4=0.25)
- "hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "4 legs" (support 1/4=0.25)
- "hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "herbivore" (support 1/4=0.25)
- "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "4 legs", "herbivore" (support 0/4=0.0)
- etc., but all have support <0.75.

Wait, but actually, for quadruples, only the ones formed by adding one more item to the triple, but since the triple already has support 1, adding any other item would give support 1 for the quadruple only if all four are present, which they aren't. So none of the quadruples meet support.

Therefore, the frequent itemsets with max length 5 and support >=0.75 are:

1. {"hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding"}
2. {"hot blood", "indeed breastfeeding", "False eggs"}
3. {"hot blood", "indeed breastfeeding", "4 legs"}
4. {"hot blood", "indeed breastfeeding", "herbivore"}
5. {"yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "4 legs"}
6. {"yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding", "herbivore"}

Wait, but wait a second. When I added "indeed breastfeeding" to "yes body hair" and "herbivore", the support was 2/4=0.5, which is below 0.75. So these shouldn't be included. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Let me re-examine the pairs. The pairs that had support >=0.75 were:

- "hot blood" + "yes body hair"
- "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding"
- "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding"

So when forming triples from these pairs, only the ones that formed a triple with support >=0.75 are included. So the only such triple is "hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding".

All other triples formed by adding a third item to the pairs only have support 0.5, which is below 0.75. Therefore, they shouldn't be included.

Similarly, for quadruples, none meet the support.

So the correct frequent itemsets are only the triple and the pairs:

Wait, no. The pairs that have support >=0.75 are:

- "hot blood" + "yes body hair" (support 1.0)
- "hot blood" + "indeed breastfeeding" (support 1.0)
- "yes body hair" + "indeed breastfeeding" (support 1.0)

So these pairs are all included as frequent itemsets of length 2.

Additionally, the triple "hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding" is also frequent.

So compiling all:

- Length 2:
  - "hot blood", "yes body hair"
  - "hot blood", "indeed breastfeeding"
  - "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding"
- Length 3:
  - "hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding"

No itemsets of length 4 or 5 meet the support.

So I think I made a mistake earlier by considering other triples that didn't meet the support. So the correct answer is only these three itemsets.
</think>

The frequent itemsets with support ≥ 0.75 and maximum length 5 are:

1. {"hot blood", "yes body hair"}
2. {"hot blood", "indeed breastfeeding"}
3. {"yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding"}
4. {"hot blood", "yes body hair", "indeed breastfeeding"}

These are the only itemsets that meet the criteria.

$\boxed{\{\text{hot blood, yes body hair\}}, \{\text{hot blood, indeed breastfeeding\}}, \{\text{yes body hair, indeed breastfeeding\}}, \{\text{hot blood, yes body hair, indeed breastfeeding\}}}$
