I will give you CSV and your job is to find frequent itemsets of maxlenght 5 with support 0.75. Do not use any code, it is your job to do!
name,legs count,diet,blood,body hair,eggs,breastfeeding
rabbit,4,herbivore,hot,yes,False,indeed
human,2,omnivore,hot,yes,False,indeed
fox,4,omnivore,hot,yes,False,indeed
platypus,4,carnivore,hot,yes,True,indeed


So, the output should be as a list of lists, with each list containing items in the itemset, ordered. Items in each list are ordered alphabetically. The entire output is ordered by the first item in each list. 

For example:

[[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ],
 [ 'a', 'b', 'd' ],
 [ 'a', 'c', 'd' ],
 ... ]

So, the output is a list of lists, not a set or anything else.

Please find such itemsets of max length 5.
Okay, I've got this CSV data to analyze and find frequent itemsets with a maximum length of 5 and a support of at least 0.75. Let me try to figure out how to approach this without coding, since I can't use any code. 

First, I need to understand the data. The CSV has the following columns: name, legs count, diet, blood, body hair, eggs, and breastfeeding. Each row represents an animal with various attributes. Wait, no, actually, each row seems to have multiple attributes, but looking closer, it seems each row has one animal with several attributes. Wait, no, actually, perhaps each row represents a record with multiple attributes for that animal. Let me parse the CSV properly.

Wait, the CSV has headers like name, legs count, diet, etc., so each row is an animal with those attributes. But looking at the data, it seems like each row is a different animal with the same set of attributes. Wait, no, wait, perhaps each row is a transaction, but in this case, each animal is a transaction, and the attributes are the items? Hmm, maybe not. Let me clarify.

Wait, perhaps each animal is an item, and the attributes are just properties of the item. But in frequent itemset mining, we look for sets of items that frequently co-occur. So, perhaps the items we can extract are the attributes. Let's list them:

- name: animal names (rabbit, human, fox, platypus)
- legs count: 4, 2, 4, 4
- diet: herbivore, omnivore, carnivore
- blood: hot
- body hair: yes, yes, yes, yes
- eggs: False, False, False, True
- breastfeeding: indeed

Wait, so the possible items from the CSV are: name (the animal), legs count (as a number?), diet, blood, body hair, eggs (boolean?), breastfeeding (boolean). But in frequent itemset mining, items are usually individual attributes, perhaps treated as categorical. But in this case, some attributes are numerical, like legs count (2,4). Hmm, but treating numerical as items might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we should convert all attributes into binary features or treat them as separate items if they are categorical.

Alternatively, perhaps each attribute can be considered as an item if it can be categorized into binary presence or absence. But wait, diet is a category with possible values herbivore, omnivore, carnivore. Similarly, legs count is numerical.

This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I need to clarify the data structure.

Wait, each row seems to represent an animal with its attributes. So, for example, the first row is a rabbit with 4 legs, herbivore diet, etc. So, perhaps each row is a transaction, and the attributes are the items in that transaction. So, each animal is a transaction, and its attributes are the items. Therefore, the possible items are name, legs count, diet, blood, body hair, eggs, breastfeeding.

But treating name as an item, and considering that each row is a single instance of that animal, then each animal occurs only once in the dataset. Similarly, legs count is 4, but that's a single value, so perhaps each animal has a single legs count. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps the CSV represents multiple items for each animal. For example, the first row has four legs, so maybe legs are a feature, and that's considered an item. So, each animal is a transaction, and the attributes of that animal are the items in the transaction.

So, for example, the first transaction is: rabbit, 4, herbivore, hot, yes, False, indeed.

Wait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe each attribute that can vary is considered an item. So, for example, diet is herbivore, omnivore, carnivore, so perhaps each is a separate item. Similarly, legs count is a numerical attribute, which can't be directly used as an item unless we discretize it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe numerical attributes are treated as single items, like "legs=4", but that might not be helpful for frequent itemset mining because each animal is unique.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently: in this CSV, each row is a record of an animal with certain attributes. So, for the purpose of association rule learning or frequent itemset mining, the items are the individual attributes, and each transaction consists of the set of attributes for that animal. So, each animal is a transaction, and the items are the attributes (name, legs count, diet, etc.).

But in that case, each animal is unique, so no two transactions would be the same, meaning no itemsets would be frequent. That can't be right. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the data structure.

Wait, perhaps the CSV is structured such that each column after 'name' represents a possible item, and each row represents a transaction where the item is present if the attribute is true. For example, the first row could be considered as containing items 'name=rabbit', 'legs=4', 'diet=herbivore', etc. But I'm not sure how that would work for frequent itemset mining.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that each animal's attributes are considered as separate items, but each animal occurs once, making all itemsets unique. That can't be, because then no itemset would have support above 0.75, which is required.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the legs count is being used as a set of possible items. For example, the legs count could be treated as a separate set, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe each attribute is a possible item, regardless of the animal, so for example, 'legs=4' is an item, 'diet=herbivore' is another, etc. So, in the CSV, each animal is a transaction where they have all their attributes, and each attribute is considered an item.

But in that case, each animal would have multiple items. So, for example, the rabbit transaction would include items: 'name=rabbit', 'legs=4', 'diet=herbivore', 'blood=hot', 'body_hair=yes', 'eggs=False', 'breastfeeding=indeed'.

Wait, but this would create a lot of items, and each animal would be a unique transaction, leading to no frequent itemsets. That can't be right either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the 'legs count' isn't an attribute to be considered as an item, but just a characteristic of the animal. So, perhaps each animal is associated with its legs count as an item, but in that case, each animal would have the same legs count, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to treat each attribute as a separate item, regardless of the animal. So, all possible legs counts, diets, blood types, etc., are considered items. But legs count is numerical, so perhaps each possible value is treated as an item. For example, legs=4, legs=2, etc. Similarly, diet has three categories, so each category would be an item. Similarly, body hair is yes or no, eggs is True or False, and breastfeeding is indeed or not.

But then, each animal in the CSV has these attributes, so each animal's attributes can be considered as a set of items.

So, for example, the first animal is a rabbit with legs=4, diet=herbivore, blood=hot, body_hair=yes, eggs=False, breastfeeding=indeed. So, the items for this transaction would be: legs=4, diet=herbivore, blood=hot, body_hair=yes, eggs=False, breastfeeding=indeed.

Wait, but if I do that, each animal is a unique transaction with multiple items. So, the rabbit has these items, human has these, etc. But then, in that case, the same set of items might appear across different animals, allowing for the calculation of support.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider each animal as a unique transaction, and each attribute is a binary feature indicating whether that attribute is present or not. But I'm not sure how that would work because the attributes aren't necessarily binary. For example, legs count can be 2 or 4. Diet has three categories: herbivore, omnivore, carnivore.

This is getting a bit too complicated, and maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps I should consider only the categorical attributes as possible items, ignoring the numerical ones. So, name, diet, blood, body hair, eggs, breastfeeding.

Wait, name is a string, but perhaps it's just a label, so including it as an item might not be useful. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to treat each attribute as an item, including the numerical ones, so legs=4 is an item, legs=2 is another, etc.

So, let's list all the possible items:

- name: rabbit, human, fox, platypus
- legs=2, legs=4
- diet: herbivore, omnivore, carnivore
- blood: hot
- body_hair: yes
- eggs: False, True
- breastfeeding: indeed

Wait, but this includes a lot of items, and each animal has multiple of these items.

So, for example, the rabbit transaction would include: legs=4, diet=herbivore, blood=hot, body_hair=yes, eggs=False, breastfeeding=indeed.

Similarly, the human would have legs=2, diet=omivore, blood=hot, body_hair=yes, eggs=False, breastfeeding=indeed.

The fox is similar to rabbit, and platypus is similar to rabbit.

So, to calculate frequent itemsets, we need to find sets of these items that appear together in multiple transactions. Since there are only four transactions, the maximum support is 4/4=100%, so any itemset that appears in all four transactions would have support 1. So, the problem is to find itemsets with length up to 5 and support >=0.75.

So, let's see.

First, let's find all individual items (length 1) that have support >= 0.75. Since each item appears in at least all four transactions, but wait, no. Let's count.

For example, legs=4 appears in rabbit, fox, platypus: 3 times.

Diet=herbivore appears in rabbit, fox, platypus: 3 times.

Legs=2 only appears in human: 1 transaction.

Diet=omivore appears in human, fox, platypus: 3 times.

Diet=carnivore appears only in platypus: 1 transaction.

Blood=hot appears in all four: 4 times.

Body_hair=yes appears in all four: 4 times.

Eggs=False appears in rabbit, human, fox, platypus: 4 times.

Eggs=True appears only in platypus: 1 transaction.

Breastfeeding=indeed appears in all four: 4 times.

So, for single items:

- legs=4: support 3 (rabbits, fox, platypus)
- legs=2: support 1 (human)
- diet=herbivore: support 3
- diet=omivore: support 3
- diet=carnivore: support 1
- blood=hot: support 4
- body_hair=yes: support 4
- eggs=False: support 4
- eggs=True: support 1
- breastfeeding=indeed: support 4

So, all single items except legs=2, diet=carnivore, eggs=True have support >=0.75 (since 3/4=0.75). So, legs=4, diet=herbivore, diet=omivore, blood=hot, body_hair=yes, eggs=False, breastfeeding=indeed are all single items that meet the support threshold.

Now, let's move on to itemsets of length 2. We need to find all pairs of items that appear together in at least 0.75 * 4 = 3 transactions.

So, for each possible pair, we check how many transactions include both.

Let me start by considering combinations that likely co-occur.

First, legs=4 appears in 3 transactions (rabbits, fox, platypus). So, any item that appears in all three plus blood=hot, etc.

But let's check possible pairs.

Let's see which pairs appear in at least 3 transactions.

For example, legs=4 and diet=herbivore: both appear in rabbit, fox, platypus. So, together they appear in 3 transactions. So, their support is 3/4=0.75, which meets the threshold.

Similarly, legs=4 and blood=hot: appears in 3 transactions (rabbits, fox, platypus).

Legs=4 and body_hair=yes: same as above, all three.

Legs=4 and eggs=False: same, all three.

Legs=4 and breastfeeding=indeed: all three, since all four animals have that.

Legs=4 and diet=omivore: no, because diet=omivore appears in human, fox, platypus. So, legs=4 and diet=omivore: does fox have legs=4? Fox has legs=4. Fox has diet=omivore, so yes, legs=4 and diet=omivore are both in fox, platypus. But human has legs=2, so legs=4 isn't there. So, legs=4 and diet=omivore appear together in three transactions: fox, platypus, rabbit (since rabbit has legs=4 and diet=herbivore. Wait, rabbit's diet is herbivore, not omnivore. Oh, right, so rabbit has legs=4 but diet=herbivore, so legs=4 and diet=omivore are together only in fox and platypus, right?

Because:

- rabbit: legs=4, diet=herbivore
- human: legs=2, diet=omivore
- fox: legs=4, diet=omivore
- platypus: legs=4, diet=carnivore

So, legs=4 and diet=omivore: in fox and platypus? Wait, no. Wait, let me see. Fox has legs=4 and diet=omivore. Platypus has legs=4 and diet=carnivore. So, legs=4 and diet=omivore appear together only in fox. So, the count would be 1, which is less than 3. So, this pair doesn't meet the support.

Similarly, legs=4 and diet=carnivore: only in platypus. So, count=1.

Legs=4 and blood=hot: appears in rabbit, fox, platypus: count=3.

Legs=4 and body_hair=yes: same as above.

Legs=4 and eggs=False: same.

Legs=4 and breastfeeding=indeed: same.

So, for legs=4, pairs with other items can be considered.

Similarly, let's look at diet=herbivore. Which other items co-occur with it?

Diet=herbivore appears in rabbit, fox, platypus.

So, let's see:

- diet=herbivore and legs=4: always true, count=3.
- diet=herbivore and blood=hot: all three have blood=hot, count=3.
- diet=herbivore and body_hair=yes: same.
- diet=herbivore and eggs=False: same.
- diet=herbivore and breastfeeding=indeed: same.
- diet=herbivore and diet=omivore: no, only in fox and platypus. So, count=2.

Similarly, diet=herbivore and legs=2: not present.

Diet=herbivore and diet=carnivore: no.

So, pairs involving diet=herbivore and legs=4, legs=4 and blood=hot, etc., meet the threshold.

Similarly, for diet=omivore.

Diet=omivore is in human, fox, platypus.

Let's check pairs with diet=omivore:

- diet=omivore and legs=4: appears in fox and platypus: count=2.
- diet=omivore and blood=hot: all three have blood=hot: count=3.
- diet=omivore and body_hair=yes: same.
- diet=omivore and eggs=False: same (fox, platypus, rabbit? Wait, rabbit has legs=4, diet=herbivore, so rabbit doesn't have diet=omivore. So, diet=omivore is in human, fox, platypus. Eggs=False is in all four. So, in human, fox, platypus, all have eggs=False. So, diet=omivore and eggs=False co-occur in three transactions.

Similarly, diet=omivore and body_hair=yes: same.

Diet=omivore and legs=2: only in human.

Diet=omivore and blood=hot: same.

So, pairs like diet=omivore and blood=hot have count=3.

Similarly, diet=omivore and body_hair=yes: count=3.

Similarly, diet=omivore and eggs=False: count=3.

Now, moving on to other combinations. Let's look at legs=4 and diet=herbivore: pair, as above.

Also, legs=4 and blood=hot.

Also, legs=4 and body_hair=yes.

Also, legs=4 and eggs=False.

Also, legs=4 and breastfeeding=indeed.

Now, let's check for two-item combinations.

Another pair could be legs=4 and diet=herbivore: as before.

Another pair is legs=4 and eggs=False: they co-occur in 3.

Similarly, legs=4 and blood=hot.

Similarly, legs=4 and body_hair=yes.

Also, legs=4 and body_hair=yes is the same as legs=4.

Wait, perhaps the combinations that meet the support are:

- legs=4 and diet=herbivore
- legs=4 and blood=hot
- legs=4 and body_hair=yes
- legs=4 and eggs=False
- legs=4 and breastfeeding=indeed

Similarly, in the cases where diet is involved:

- diet=herbivore and legs=4
- diet=herbivore and blood=hot
- diet=herbivore and body_hair=yes
- diet=herbivore and eggs=False
- diet=herbivore and breastfeeding=indeed

Wait, but wait, for diet=herbivore, legs=4 is already considered.

Similarly, let's check for other possible pairs.

How about blood=hot and body_hair=yes: both are in all four transactions. So, their support is 4/4=1.

Same with blood=hot and eggs=False: all four have that.

Similarly, body_hair=yes and eggs=False: all four.

Breastfeeding=indeed and any other item: all four have that.

So, that's a lot of two-item combinations, but let's try to list all that meet the support.

So, for two-item combinations, we have:

- legs=4 and diet=herbivore
- legs=4 and blood=hot
- legs=4 and body_hair=yes
- legs=4 and eggs=False
- legs=4 and breastfeeding=indeed
- diet=herbivore and blood=hot
- diet=herbivore and body_hair=yes
- diet=herbivore and eggs=False
- diet=herbivore and breastfeeding=indeed
- legs=4 and any of the other single items (except diet=carnivore, eggs=True)
- similarly, blood=hot and any of the other items (e.g., body_hair=yes, etc.)

Wait, this could get extensive. Let's see: any pair of items that appear together in at least 3 transactions.

For example:

- blood=hot and body_hair=yes: both appear in all four, so count=4
- blood=hot and eggs=False: same, all four
- blood=hot and breastfeeding=indeed: same
- body_hair=yes and eggs=False: same
- body_hair=yes and breastfeeding=indeed: same
- eggs=False and breastfeeding=indeed: same
- blood=hot and any of the other items: they all appear together in all four.

Similarly, diet=herbivore and any of legs=4, blood=hot, body_hair=yes, eggs=False, breastfeeding=indeed: each of these pairs appears in three transactions (rabbit, fox, platypus). So, count=3 for each.

Similarly, diet=omivore and any of legs=4 (only in fox and platypus), blood=hot, body_hair=yes, eggs=False: but diet=omivore is in human, fox, platypus. So, let's see:

- diet=omivore and legs=4: appears in two transactions (fox and platypus), which is less than 3. So, this pair doesn't meet the threshold.
- diet=omivore and blood=hot: appears in three transactions (human, fox, platypus). So, count=3.
- Similarly, diet=omivore and body_hair=yes: count=3.
- diet=omivore and eggs=False: count=3.
- diet=omivore and breastfeeding=indeed: count=3.

Wait, yes, because:

- human: diet=omivore, blood=hot, body_hair=yes, eggs=False, breastfeeding=indeed.
- fox: same as above.
- platypus: diet=omivore, etc.

So, diet=omivore appears in human, fox, platypus. So, pairs with blood=hot, body_hair=yes, eggs=False, and breastfeeding=indeed would co-occur in all three, count=3.

So, that's acceptable.

Similarly, diet=carnivore is only in platypus, so it won't form any pairs that meet the threshold except in combinations where the other item is in platypus. But since support is >=0.75, which is 3, and there's only
