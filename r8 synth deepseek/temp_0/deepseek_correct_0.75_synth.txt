I will give you CSV and your job is to find frequent itemsets of maxlenght 5 with support 0.75. Do not use any code, it is your job to do!<csv>

To find the frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with a support of 0.75, we analyze the given CSV data. Here are the frequent itemsets:

- **body hair, yes**: 100.00% (5/5)
- **breastfeeding, indeed**: 100.00% (5/5)
- **hot, indeed**: 100.00% (5/5)

No other itemsets meet the support threshold of 0.75.
