To find frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with support 0.75, we analyze the given CSV data. Each row represents a transaction, and each column represents an item. We need to identify itemsets (combinations of items) that appear in at least 75% of the transactions.

### Step 1: List All Transactions
First, we list all transactions:

1. 354C31, DBCEEF, 6CE255, 199D26, D59553, 331981, 869F50
2. B2895C, B0FAAD, 9ED0E8, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999
3. 1520D1, 49E95E, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999
4. 0BEA8D, B0FAAD, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999
5. 7EA60D, B0FAAD, C5B9CC, D11884, 269963, 420666, 999999

### Step 2: Count Item Frequencies
Next, we count the frequency of each individual item:

- **B0FAAD**: appears in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)
- **D11884**: appears in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)
- **269963**: appears in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)
- **ADC8A2**: appears in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)

### Step 3: Identify Frequent Items
Items that appear at least 4 times (80% of 5 transactions) are considered frequent:

- **B0FAAD**
- **D11884**
- **269963**
- **ADC8A2**

### Step 4: Generate Itemsets of Length 2
Now, we check for pairs of frequent items that co-occur in at least 4 transactions.

- **B0FAAD & D11884**: co-occurs in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)
- **B0FAAD & 269963**: co-occurs in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)
- **B0FAAD & ADC8A2**: co-occurs in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)
- **D11884 & 269963**: co-occurs in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)
- **D11884 & ADC8A2**: co-occurs in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)
- **269963 & ADC8A2**: co-occurs in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)

### Step 5: Generate Itemsets of Length 3
Next, we check for triplets of frequent items that co-occur in at least 4 transactions.

- **B0FAAD, D11884, 269963**: co-occurs in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)
- **B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2**: co-occurs in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)
- **B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2**: co-occurs in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)

### Step 6: Generate Itemsets of Length 4
Finally, we check for quartets of frequent items that co-occur in at least 4 transactions.

- **B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2**: co-occurs in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times (80%)

### Final Frequent Itemsets
All frequent itemsets with support ≥ 0.75 are:

1. **B0FAAD** (80%)
2. **D11884** (80%)
3. **269963** (80%)
4. **ADC8A2** (80%)
5. **B0FAAD & D11884** (80%)
6. **B0FAAD & 269963** (80%)
7. **B0FAAD & ADC8A2** (80%)
8. **D11884 & 269963** (80%)
9. **D11884 & ADC8A2** (80%)
10. **269963 & ADC8A2** (80%)
11. **B0FAAD, D11884, 269963** (80%)
12. **B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2** (80%)
13. **B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2** (80%)
14. **B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2** (80%)

### Answer
The frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with support 0.75 are:
