I will give you CSV and your job is to find frequent itemsets of maxlenght 5 with support 0.75. Do not use any code, it is your job to do!<csv>

To find the frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with a support of 0.75, we first need to analyze the given dataset. The dataset consists of 4 records, each representing an animal with attributes: name, legs count, diet, blood, body hair, eggs, and breastfeeding. 

We will look for itemsets (combinations of attributes) that appear in at least 3 out of 4 records (since 3/4 = 0.75). 

After evaluating all possible combinations, the only itemset that meets the support requirement is:

- **legs count = 6**

This itemset appears in 3 out of 4 records (rabbit, fox, platypus).

### Frequent Itemsets:
- **legs count = 6** (Support: 0.75)
