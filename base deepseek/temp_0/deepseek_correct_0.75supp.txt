I will give you CSV and your job is to find frequent itemsets of maxlenght 5 with support 0.75. Do not use any code, it is your job to do!
name,legs count,diet,blood,body hair,eggs,breastfeeding
rabbit,4,herbivore,hot,yes,False,indeed
human,2,omnivore,hot,yes,False,indeed
fox,4,omnivore,hot,yes,False,indeed
platypus,4,carnivore,hot,yes,True,indeed


Okay, so I have this CSV with some data about animals and various attributes. My task is to find frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with a support of 0.75. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what an itemset is. From what I remember, in data mining, an itemset is a collection of items. In this context, each row in the CSV represents a transaction, and each column represents an item. So, each animal's data is a transaction where the attributes are the items.

Wait, but looking at the CSV, each row has multiple attributes: name, legs count, diet, blood, body hair, eggs, breastfeeding. So, each of these is a separate item. For example, the first row has rabbit, 4, herbivore, hot, yes, False, indeed. So, each of these is an item in the transaction.

But wait, some of these are numerical values, like legs count, body hair, etc. Hmm, how do we handle numerical values in itemsets? I think in this context, each attribute is treated as a separate item, regardless of whether it's numerical or categorical. So, legs count is an item, diet is another, and so on.

So, each transaction is a set of items. For example, the first transaction is {name: rabbit, legs count:4, diet:herbivore, blood:hot, body hair:yes, eggs:False, breastfeeding:indeed}.

But wait, the support is 0.75, which means that an itemset must appear in at least 75% of the transactions. Since there are 4 transactions, 75% of 4 is 3. So, an itemset must appear in at least 3 transactions to be considered frequent.

Okay, so I need to find all itemsets (combinations of items) where each itemset appears in at least 3 out of the 4 transactions. Also, the maximum length of the itemset is 5, so I can only consider itemsets with up to 5 items.

But wait, the maximum length is 5, but the number of items per transaction is 7. So, I need to consider all possible combinations of up to 5 items from these 7, and check their support.

But this seems like a lot of combinations. Let me see: the number of possible itemsets of size 1 is 7, size 2 is 21, size 3 is 35, size 4 is 35, size 5 is 21. So, in total, 119 possible itemsets. Checking each of these for support would be time-consuming, but since the dataset is small, maybe I can do it manually.

Alternatively, maybe I can find frequent individual items first, then build up to larger itemsets.

Let's start by listing all the items and counting their occurrences.

Looking at the dataset:

1. rabbit,4,herbivore,hot,yes,False,indeed
2. human,2,omnivore,hot,yes,False,indeed
3. fox,4,omnivore,hot,yes,False,indeed
4. platypus,4,carnivore,hot,yes,True,indeed

So, the items are:

name: rabbit, human, fox, platypus

legs count:4,2,4,4

diet: herbivore, omnivore, omnivore, carnivore

blood: hot, hot, hot, hot

body hair: yes, yes, yes, yes

eggs: False, False, False, True

breastfeeding: indeed, indeed, indeed, indeed

Wait, but in the CSV, each row has these attributes, so each of these is an item. So, for example, 'name' is an item, 'legs count' is another, etc.

But wait, 'legs count' is a numerical value, but in the context of itemsets, each attribute is treated as a separate item. So, for example, 'legs count' is an item, 'diet' is another, etc.

So, each transaction has 7 items: name, legs count, diet, blood, body hair, eggs, breastfeeding.

Now, let's count the occurrences of each individual item.

name: appears in all 4 transactions. So, support is 4/4 = 1.0, which is above 0.75.

legs count: appears in all 4 transactions as well, since each has a value. So, support is 1.0.

diet: herbivore appears in 1st transaction, omnivore in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. So, omnivore appears 3 times, herbivore once. So, support for omnivore is 3/4 = 0.75, which meets the threshold. Herbivore is exactly at 0.25, so it's below.

blood: hot appears in all 4 transactions. Support is 1.0.

body hair: yes appears in all 4. Support 1.0.

eggs: False appears in 1st, 2nd, 3rd transactions, and True in 4th. So, False appears 3 times, which is 0.75. True appears once, which is below.

breastfeeding: indeed appears in all 4. Support 1.0.

So, individual items with support >=0.75 are:

name, legs count, omnivore, blood, body hair, eggs=False, breastfeeding.

Now, moving on to itemsets of size 2.

We need to find all pairs of items that appear together in at least 3 transactions.

Let's list all possible pairs and count their co-occurrences.

But this is going to be time-consuming. Maybe I can find which pairs are likely to be frequent.

First, let's consider pairs involving the most frequent individual items.

name: appears in all 4, so pairing it with others.

legs count: also appears in all 4.

omnivore: appears in 3.

blood: all 4.

body hair: all 4.

eggs=False: 3.

breastfeeding: all 4.

So, let's start with name and legs count. They appear together in all 4 transactions. So, support is 1.0.

name and omnivore: name is in all 4, omnivore is in 3. Let's see in which transactions both are present.

Transaction 1: name=rabbit, omnivore=no.

Transaction 2: name=human, omnivore=omnivore.

Transaction 3: name=fox, omnivore=omnivore.

Transaction 4: name=platypus, omnivore=carnivore.

So, name and omnivore are together in transactions 2,3. So, 2 out of 4. Support is 0.5, which is below 0.75. So, this pair is not frequent.

Similarly, name and blood: name is in all 4, blood is in all 4. So, support is 1.0.

name and body hair: same, support 1.0.

name and eggs=False: name is in all 4, eggs=False is in 3. Let's see when both are present.

Transaction 1: eggs=False.

Transaction 2: eggs=False.

Transaction 3: eggs=False.

Transaction 4: eggs=True.

So, name and eggs=False are together in transactions 1,2,3. So, 3 out of 4. Support is 0.75, which meets the threshold.

So, {name, eggs=False} is a frequent itemset.

Similarly, name and breastfeeding: both in all 4. Support 1.0.

Now, legs count and omnivore: legs count is in all 4, omnivore in 3.

Legs count=4 in transactions 1,3,4. Omnivore in 2,3. So, legs count=4 and omnivore together in transaction 3. So, only 1 transaction. Support is 0.25, below threshold.

Legs count and blood: both in all 4. Support 1.0.

Legs count and body hair: both in all 4. Support 1.0.

Legs count and eggs=False: legs count=4 in 1,3,4. Eggs=False in 1,2,3. So, together in 1,3. So, 2 transactions. Support 0.5, below.

Legs count and breastfeeding: both in all 4. Support 1.0.

Omnivore and blood: omnivore in 2,3; blood in all 4. So, together in 2,3. Support 2/4=0.5, below.

Omnivore and body hair: both in all 4. Support 1.0.

Omnivore and eggs=False: omnivore in 2,3; eggs=False in 1,2,3. So, together in 2,3. Support 2/4=0.5, below.

Omnivore and breastfeeding: omnivore in 2,3; breastfeeding in all 4. So, together in 2,3. Support 0.5, below.

Blood and body hair: both in all 4. Support 1.0.

Blood and eggs=False: blood in all 4, eggs=False in 3. So, together in 3. Support 0.75, meets threshold.

Blood and breastfeeding: both in all 4. Support 1.0.

Body hair and eggs=False: body hair in all 4, eggs=False in 3. Together in 3. Support 0.75, meets threshold.

Body hair and breastfeeding: both in all 4. Support 1.0.

Eggs=False and breastfeeding: eggs=False in 3, breastfeeding in all 4. Together in 3. Support 0.75, meets threshold.

Now, let's check some other pairs.

Name and eggs=False: already done.

Name and blood: done.

Name and body hair: done.

Name and legs count: done.

Name and breastfeeding: done.

Legs count and blood: done.

Legs count and body hair: done.

Legs count and eggs=False: done.

Legs count and breastfeeding: done.

Omnivore and blood: done.

Omnivore and body hair: done.

Omnivore and eggs=False: done.

Omnivore and breastfeeding: done.

Blood and body hair: done.

Blood and eggs=False: done.

Blood and breastfeeding: done.

Body hair and eggs=False: done.

Body hair and breastfeeding: done.

Eggs=False and breastfeeding: done.

So, all pairs involving the most frequent items have been checked. Now, let's see if there are any other pairs that might have support >=0.75.

For example, legs count and eggs=False: support 2/4=0.5, below.

Legs count and omnivore: support 1/4=0.25, below.

Legs count and eggs=True: only in transaction 4. Support 0.25, below.

Omnivore and eggs=False: support 2/4=0.5, below.

Omnivore and eggs=True: only in transaction 4. Support 0.25, below.

So, I think all pairs have been considered, and only the following pairs meet the support threshold:

- name and eggs=False (support 3/4=0.75)

- name and breastfeeding (support 1.0)

- legs count and blood (support 1.0)

- legs count and body hair (support 1.0)

- legs count and breastfeeding (support 1.0)

- eggs=False and breastfeeding (support 3/4=0.75)

- blood and eggs=False (support 1/4=0.25? Wait, no, earlier I thought support was 1/4, but let me check.

Wait, in transaction 1: blood=hot, eggs=False.

Transaction 2: blood=hot, eggs=False.

Transaction 3: blood=hot, eggs=False.

Transaction 4: blood=hot, eggs=True.

So, eggs=False and blood together in transactions 1,2,3. So, support is 3/4=0.75.

Wait, earlier I thought support was 1/4, but that was a mistake. So, eggs=False and blood together in 3 transactions, support 0.75.

Similarly, eggs=False and body hair: support 3/4=0.75.

Eggs=False and breastfeeding: support 3/4=0.75.

So, the pairs that meet the support are:

1. {name, eggs=False}

2. {name, breastfeeding}

3. {legs count, blood}

4. {legs count, body hair}

5. {legs count, breastfeeding}

6. {eggs=False, blood}

7. {eggs=False, body hair}

8. {eggs=False, breastfeeding}

Now, moving on to itemsets of size 3.

We need to find all triplets of items that appear together in at least 3 transactions.

This is going to be more involved. Let's see which triplets could potentially meet the support.

First, let's consider triplets involving the most frequent items.

For example, {name, eggs=False, blood}: we know that name and eggs=False are together in 3 transactions, and in those same transactions, blood is also present. So, support is 3/4=0.75.

Similarly, {name, eggs=False, body hair}: same logic, support 3/4.

{name, eggs=False, breastfeeding}: support 3/4.

{legs count, blood, body hair}: legs count=4 in transactions 1,3,4. Blood=hot in all. Body hair=yes in all. So, legs count=4, blood=hot, body hair=yes together in transactions 1,3,4. So, support 3/4.

{legs count, blood, eggs=False}: legs count=4 in 1,3,4. Blood=hot in all. Eggs=False in 1,2,3. So, together in 1,3. Support 2/4=0.5, below.

{legs count, blood, body hair, eggs=False}: Wait, that's a size 4 itemset, but we're looking for size 3 first.

Wait, maybe {legs count, blood, eggs=False} is not frequent, as support is 2/4.

Similarly, {legs count, body hair, eggs=False}: legs count=4 in 1,3,4. Body hair=yes in all. Eggs=False in 1,2,3. So, together in 1,3. Support 2/4=0.5, below.

{legs count, blood, eggs=False, body hair}: size 4, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Let me think of other triplets.

What about {name, eggs=False, blood}: support 3/4.

{name, eggs=False, body hair}: support 3/4.

{name, eggs=False, breastfeeding}: support 3/4.

{legs count, blood, body hair}: support 3/4.

Are there any others?

Let's see.

What about {name, legs count, eggs=False}: name and legs count are always together, and eggs=False is in 3. So, together in 3 transactions. Support 3/4=0.75.

Similarly, {name, legs count, body hair}: support 3/4.

{name, legs count, breastfeeding}: support 3/4.

{legs count, blood, body hair}: support 3/4.

{legs count, blood, eggs=False}: support 2/4=0.5, below.

{legs count, body hair, eggs=False}: support 2/4=0.5, below.

{legs count, blood, body hair, eggs=False}: size 4, but let's check support. Legs count=4 in 1,3,4. Blood=hot in all. Body hair=yes in all. Eggs=False in 1,2,3. So, together in 1,3. Support 2/4=0.5, below.

What about {name, eggs=False, blood, body hair}: size 4, but support is 3/4.

Wait, but we're looking for size 3 first.

So, the triplets that meet support are:

1. {name, eggs=False, blood}

2. {name, eggs=False, body hair}

3. {name, eggs=False, breastfeeding}

4. {legs count, blood, body hair}

5. {name, legs count, eggs=False}

6. {name, legs count, body hair}

7. {name, legs count, breastfeeding}

8. {legs count, blood, body hair}

Wait, but {name, legs count, eggs=False} is the same as {name, eggs=False, legs count}, which is the same as {name, legs count, eggs=False}. So, it's the same triplet.

Similarly, {name, legs count, body hair} is the same as {name, body hair, legs count}.

Same with {name, legs count, breastfeeding}.

So, these are all valid triplets.

Now, moving on to size 4 itemsets.

We need to find all 4-itemsets that appear in at least 3 transactions.

Let's see which 4-itemsets could meet this.

First, {name, eggs=False, blood, body hair}: legs count is 4 in 1,3,4. Eggs=False in 1,2,3. Blood in all. Body hair in all. So, together in 1,3. Support 2/4=0.5, below.

{name, eggs=False, blood, breastfeeding}: legs count=4 in 1,3,4. Eggs=False in 1,2,3. Blood in all. Body hair in all. So, together in 1,3. Support 2/4=0.5, below.

{name, eggs=False, body hair, breastfeeding}: legs count=4 in 1,3,4. Eggs=False in 1,2,3. Body hair in all. So, together in 1,3. Support 2/4=0.5, below.

{legs count, blood, body hair, eggs=False}: legs count=4 in 1,3,4. Blood in all. Body hair in all. Eggs=False in 1,2,3. So, together in 1,3. Support 2/4=0.5, below.

{legs count, blood, body hair, body hair}: Wait, body hair is an item, but it's the same as body hair. So, it's a 4-itemset with duplicates, which is not allowed in itemsets. So, we can ignore that.

What about {name, legs count, eggs=False, body hair}: legs count=4 in 1,3,4. Eggs=False in 1,2,3. Body hair in all. So, together in 1,3. Support 2/4=0.5, below.

{name, legs count, eggs=False, breastfeeding}: together in 1,3. Support 2/4=0.5, below.

{legs count, blood, body hair, eggs=False}: same as above, support 2/4.

So, it seems that all 4-itemsets have support below 0.75.

Wait, let me check another 4-itemset.

What about {name, eggs=False, blood, body hair}: support 2/4=0.5.

{legs count, blood, body hair, eggs=False}: support 2/4=0.5.

Is there any other 4-itemset that could have support >=0.75?

What about {name, legs count, eggs=False, blood}: legs count=4 in 1,3,4. Eggs=False in 1,2,3. Blood in all. So, together in 1,3. Support 2/4=0.5.

Similarly, {name, legs count, eggs=False, body hair}: same as above.

{legs count, blood, body hair, eggs=False}: same as above.

So, no 4-itemset meets the support threshold.

Therefore, the frequent itemsets are all those of size 1, 2, and 3 that we found earlier.

So, compiling the list:

Size 1:

- name

- legs count

- blood

- body hair

- eggs=False

- breastfeeding

Size 2:

- {name, eggs=False}

- {name, breastfeeding}

- {legs count, blood}

- {legs count, body hair}

- {legs count, breastfeeding}

- {eggs=False, blood}

- {eggs=False, body hair}

- {eggs=False, breastfeeding}

Size 3:

- {name, eggs=False, blood}

- {name, eggs=False, body hair}

- {name, eggs=False, breastfeeding}

- {legs count, blood, body hair}

- {name, legs count, eggs=False}

- {name, legs count, body hair}

- {name, legs count, breastfeeding}

- {legs count, blood, body hair}

Wait, but some of these size 3 itemsets are duplicates in terms of the items they contain, just ordered differently. So, for example, {name, legs count, eggs=False} is the same as {eggs=False, legs count, name}.

But in terms of itemsets, the order doesn't matter, so each unique combination is counted once.

So, the final list of frequent itemsets is all the ones we found, without duplicates.

So, to summarize:

All individual items with support >=0.75:

- name

- legs count

- blood

- body hair

- eggs=False

- breastfeeding

All pairs with support >=0.75:

- {name, eggs=False}

- {name, breastfeeding}

- {legs count, blood}

- {legs count, body hair}

- {legs count, breastfeeding}

- {eggs=False, blood}

- {eggs=False, body hair}

- {eggs=False, breastfeeding}

All triplets with support >=0.75:

- {name, eggs=False, blood}

- {name, eggs=False, body hair}

- {name, eggs=False, breastfeeding}

- {legs count, blood, body hair}

- {name, legs count, eggs=False}

- {name, legs count, body hair}

- {name, legs count, breastfeeding}

- {legs count, blood, body hair}

And no 4-itemsets meet the support threshold.

So, these are all the frequent itemsets of size up to 3.
</think>

To determine the frequent itemsets with a minimum support of 0.75, we analyze the given dataset using association rule mining techniques. Each transaction is broken down into individual items, and we count the occurrences of each item and itemset.

### Step 1: Count Individual Item Occurrences
-
