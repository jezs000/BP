Ok, so I need to find frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with support 0.75. The dataset is a CSV, and from the data, it looks like it's about animals, their legs count, diet, etc.

First, I'll parse the CSV data. There are three attributes besides the name: legs count, diet, and others. Each row has the species and various attributes.

I notice that the data is very limited. There are only four species: rabbit, human, fox, and platypus. Each of these has a fixed number of attributes.

Let me list out the attributes for each species:

- rabbit: legs count=4, diet=herbivore, blood=hot, body hair=yes
- human: legs count=2, diet=omnivore, blood=hot, body hair=yes
- fox: legs count=4, diet=omnivore, blood=hot, body hair=yes
- platypus: legs count=4, diet=carnivore, blood=hot, body hair=no

Wait, the body hair attribute for platypus is 'no'. For the others, it's 'yes' except for rabbit, which is 'yes', human and fox which are 'yes'.

Now, the task is to find frequent itemsets. An itemset is a set of attributes that co-occur frequently. The support is the proportion of transactions where the itemset appears.

Support threshold is 0.75, meaning we're looking for itemsets that appear in at least 75% of the transactions.

There are 4 transactions (species), so support needs to be at least ceil(4 * 0.75) = 3. So, an itemset must appear in at least 3 out of 4 species.

Let's list all possible itemsets of length 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and check their support.

First, list all possible attributes:

1. legs count=4
2. legs count=2
3. diet=herbivore
4. diet=omnivore
5. diet=carnivore
6. blood=hot
7. body hair=yes
8. body hair=no

Now, let's find the frequent itemsets.

Starting with single attributes (length 1):

1. legs count=4: appears in rabbit, fox. So count=2. Support=2/4=0.5 <0.75. Not frequent.
2. legs count=2: only human. Count=1. Not frequent.
3. diet=herbivore: only rabbit. Count=1. Not frequent.
4. diet=omnivore: human and fox. Count=2. Support=0.5. Not frequent.
5. diet=carnivore: only platypus. Count=1. Not frequent.
6. blood=hot: all four. Count=4. Support=1.0. Frequent.
7. body hair=yes: rabbit, human, fox. Count=3. Support=3/4=0.75. Frequent.
8. body hair=no: only platypus. Count=1. Not frequent.

So, single attribute frequent itemsets are:

- blood=hot (all)
- body hair=yes (3/4)
- legs count=2 (only human)
- diet=omnivore (human and fox)
- diet=omnivore is the only one with support 0.5, which is exactly 0.75. Wait, wait, no. Wait, for single attributes, only blood=hot has support 1.0, body hair=yes has 0.75, others have lower.

Now, moving to length 2 itemsets:

We need to consider all possible pairs of the single attribute frequent itemsets and check if they co-occur in enough transactions.

But it's more efficient to check all possible pairs and see their support.

Possible pairs:

1. legs count=4 & legs count=2: Not possible, since they are mutually exclusive.
2. legs count=4 & diet=herbivore: Only rabbit. Support=1/4=0.25.
3. legs count=4 & diet=omnivore: Only fox. Support=1/4=0.25.
4. legs count=4 & diet=carnivore: Only platypus. Support=1/4=0.25.
5. legs count=4 & blood=hot: legs count=4 and blood=hot. Let's see: legs count=4 is in rabbit, fox. Both have blood=hot. So support=2/4=0.5.
6. legs count=4 & body hair=yes: legs count=4 is in rabbit, fox. Both have body hair=yes. Support=2/4=0.5.
7. legs count=2 & diet=herbivore: Only rabbit has legs count=2 and diet=herbivore. Support=1/4=0.25.
8. legs count=2 & diet=omnivore: Only human has legs count=2 and diet=omnivore. Support=1/4=0.25.
9. legs count=2 & diet=carnivore: Only platypus. Support=1/4=0.25.
10. legs count=2 & blood=hot: Only human has legs count=2 and blood=hot. Support=1/4=0.25.
11. legs count=2 & body hair=yes: Only human has legs count=2 and body hair=yes. Support=1/4=0.25.
12. diet=herbivore & diet=omnivore: Not possible.
13. diet=herbivore & diet=carnivore: Not possible.
14. diet=herbivore & blood=hot: Only rabbit. Support=1/4=0.25.
15. diet=herbivore & body hair=yes: Only rabbit. Support=1/4=0.25.
16. diet=omnivore & blood=hot: human and fox both have diet=omnivore and blood=hot. Support=2/4=0.5.
17. diet=omnivore & body hair=yes: human and fox both have diet=omnivore and body hair=yes. Support=2/4=0.5.
18. diet=carnivore & blood=hot: Only platypus. Support=1/4=0.25.
19. diet=carnivore & body hair=yes: Only platypus. Support=1/4=0.25.
20. blood=hot & body hair=yes: All four have blood=hot and body hair=yes. Support=1.0.
21. blood=hot & legs count=4: support=0.5 as above.
22. body hair=yes & legs count=4: support=0.5 as above.
23. body hair=yes & diet=omnivore: human and fox. Support=2/4=0.5.
24. body hair=yes & legs count=2: Only human. Support=0.25.

From the above, the only pairs with support >=0.75 are:

- blood=hot & body hair=yes (support=1.0)
- legs count=4 & blood=hot (support=0.5) <0.75
- legs count=4 & body hair=yes (support=0.5) <0.75
- diet=omnivore & blood=hot (support=0.5) <0.75
- diet=omnivore & body hair=yes (support=0.5) <0.75

None of the length 2 itemsets have support >=0.75.

Now, moving to length 3 itemsets:

We'll need to consider combinations of the single attribute frequent itemsets and check their support.

Possible combinations:

1. legs count=4, blood=hot, body hair=yes
2. legs count=4, body hair=yes, diet=omnivore
3. legs count=2, blood=hot, body hair=yes
4. body hair=yes, diet=omnivore, blood=hot
5. body hair=yes, legs count=4, diet=omnivore
6. legs count=2, body hair=yes, diet=omnivore
7. legs count=2, diet=omnivore, blood=hot
8. legs count=2, body hair=yes, legs count=4
9. body hair=yes, legs count=4, body hair=yes, diet=omnivore

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to check all possible 3-length combinations.

But considering that most of the 2-length itemsets are not frequent, their combinations are unlikely to be frequent.

Let's check:

1. legs count=4, blood=hot, body hair=yes: legs count=4 is in rabbit, fox. Both have blood=hot and body hair=yes. So support=2/4=0.5 <0.75.
2. legs count=4, body hair=yes, diet=omnivore: legs count=4 is rabbit, fox. Both have body hair=yes, but only fox has diet=omnivore. So support=1/4=0.25.
3. legs count=2, blood=hot, body hair=yes: Only human has legs count=2, blood=hot, body hair=yes. Support=1/4=0.25.
4. body hair=yes, diet=omnivore, blood=hot: human and fox have body hair=yes, diet=omnivore, blood=hot. Support=2/4=0.5 <0.75.
5. legs count=4, body hair=yes, legs count=2: Not possible.
6. legs count=2, body hair=yes, diet=omnivore: Only human. Support=0.25.
7. legs count=2, body hair=yes, blood=hot: Only human. Support=0.25.
8. legs count=2, body hair=no, ...: Not relevant.

So, no length 3 itemsets have support >=0.75.

Moving to length 4 itemsets:

Again, considering combinations. The single attribute frequent itemsets are:

- blood=hot
- body hair=yes
- diet=omnivore

But their combinations are not frequent as seen above.

So, no length 4 itemsets.

Finally, length 5: Only one possible itemset with all five attributes. But since we can't have more than 3 frequent single attributes, their combinations are not frequent.

Therefore, the only frequent itemsets are the single attribute ones with length 1 and 2:

- blood=hot
- body hair=yes
- legs count=2
- diet=omnivore

Wait, but legs count=2 and diet=omnivore: their co-occurrence is only in human, so support=1/4=0.25, which is less than 0.75. So that's not frequent.

Similarly, legs count=4 and body hair=yes: support=0.5.

Wait, but earlier I found that body hair=yes and diet=omnivore have support=0.5.

So, the only frequent itemsets are:

- blood=hot (all)
- body hair=yes (3/4)
- legs count=2 (only human)
- diet=omnivore (human and fox)

Wait, but for the combination of blood=hot and body hair=yes, that's support=1.0, which is frequent.

Similarly, blood=hot and legs count=4: support=0.5.

But since we're looking for itemsets, not association rules, the maximum length is 5, but in this case, the maximum frequent itemsets are of length 3, but none meet the support.

Wait, no. Actually, the maximum frequent itemset is the combination of all three: blood=hot, body hair=yes, and diet=omnivore.

Let's check that:

blood=hot, body hair=yes, diet=omnivore.

How many species have all three? human has all three: legs count=2, body hair=yes, diet=omnivore. Fox also has blood=hot and body hair=yes, but diet=omnivore. Platypus has blood=hot and body hair=no, so no. Rabbit has blood=hot and body hair=yes, but diet=herbivore.

So, only human and fox have all three. Support=2/4=0.5 <0.75. So not frequent.

So, the only frequent itemsets are the single attributes:

- blood=hot
- body hair=yes
- legs count=2
- diet=omnivore

But wait, legs count=2 and body hair=yes: only human has both. Support=0.25.

Similarly, legs count=4 and body hair=yes: support=0.5.

So, the only itemsets with support >=0.75 are:

- blood=hot
- body hair=yes
- legs count=2
- diet=omnivore

But wait, is there any combination where these single attributes co-occur with higher support?

For example, blood=hot, body hair=yes, and legs count=hot: but legs count=hot is not a single attribute, it's legs count=4.

Wait, legs count=4 is not a frequent single attribute, as it only appears in 2 out of 4.

So, no.

Therefore, the frequent itemsets are the four single attribute ones.

Wait, but the problem says "frequent itemsets of max length 5". So, including all lengths up to 5, but only those with support >=0.75.

So, the answer is the four single attribute itemsets:

1. blood=hot
2. body hair=yes
3. legs count=2
4. diet=omnivore

But wait, let's double-check the counts.

For blood=hot: all 4 species have it. Support=1.0.

For body hair=yes: 3 species. Support=0.75.

For legs count=2: only human. Support=0.25.

For diet=omnivore: human and fox. Support=0.5.

So, only blood=hot and body hair=yes are frequent, but body hair=yes has support exactly 0.75, which meets the threshold.

So, the frequent itemsets are:

- blood=hot
- body hair=yes

Additionally, any subsets of these that are also frequent. But since they are single attributes, their subsets are not applicable.

Wait, but if I consider the itemset {blood=hot, body hair=yes}, support is 1.0, which is >=0.75. So this is also a frequent itemset.

Similarly, {blood=hot, legs count=2}: support=0.5 <0.75.

{blood=hot, diet=omnivore}: support=0.5 <0.75.

{body hair=yes, legs count=2}: support=0.25.

{body hair=yes, diet=omnivore}: support=0.5 <0.75.

So, only the combination of blood=hot and body hair=yes is another frequent itemset.

Similarly, {body hair=yes, legs count=2}: support=0.25.

So, the frequent itemsets are:

1. blood=hot
2. body hair=yes
3. {blood=hot, body hair=yes}

Additionally, are there any other combinations?

For example, {legs count=2, body hair=yes}: support=0.25.

{legs count=2, diet=omnivore}: support=0.25.

{body hair=yes, diet=omnivore}: support=0.5.

So, no.

Thus, the complete list of frequent itemsets is:

- blood=hot
- body hair=yes
- {blood=hot, body hair=yes}

Wait, but body hair=yes is a single attribute, and {blood=hot, body hair=yes} is a combination.

So, the answer should include both the single and the two-length itemset.

Therefore, the final answer is:

- {blood=hot}
- {body hair=yes}
- {blood=hot, body hair=yes}

Additionally, {legs count=2} and {diet=omnivore} are also frequent, but their combinations are not.

Wait, but {legs count=2} has support=0.25, which is less than 0.75, so it's not frequent on its own. Similarly, {diet=omnivore} has support=0.5, so it's not frequent on its own. So, the only itemsets that are frequent are {blood=hot}, {body hair=yes}, and {blood=hot, body hair=yes}.

But wait, body hair=yes is frequent on its own, but its combination with other attributes may not be. So, the complete list is:

1. {blood=hot}
2. {body hair=yes}
3. {blood=hot, body hair=yes}

I think that's it.
</think>

The frequent itemsets with support ≥ 0.75 are:

1. {blood=hot}
2. {body hair=yes}
3. {blood=hot, body hair=yes}
