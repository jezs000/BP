</csv>
Okay, so I've got this CSV with some animal data, and my task is to find frequent itemsets of maximum length 5 with a support of 0.75. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what each column represents. The attributes are "name", "legs count", "diet", "blood", "body hair", "eggs", and "breastfeeding". Each row corresponds to a different animal: rabbit, human, fox, and platypus.

Support is the proportion of transactions (rows) in which the itemset appears. So, with a support of 0.75, an itemset must appear in at least 3 out of 4 rows.

Since there are only 4 rows, I can check each possible combination of attributes to see if they meet the support threshold.

Let me list out all possible attributes and their values:

1. name: rabbit, human, fox, platypus
2. legs count: 4, 2, 4, 4
3. diet: herbivore, omnivore, carnivore, carnivore
4. blood: hot, hot, hot, hot
5. body hair: yes, yes, yes, yes
6. eggs: False, False, False, True
7. breastfeeding: indeed, indeed, indeed, indeed

Wait, I notice that "legs count" is numerical, but in this dataset, it's categorical with values 2 and 4. Similarly, "diet" is categorical with herbivore, omnivore, carnivore. "Blood" is always hot, "body hair" is always yes, "eggs" is either False or True, and "breastfeeding" is always indeed.

Hmm, maybe I should convert these into categorical variables for association rule mining.

Let me list all possible single attributes first and check their support.

- name: rabbit appears once, human once, fox once, platypus once. All have support 0.25, which is below 0.75. So none of the single "name" itemsets are frequent.
- legs count: 4 appears three times, 2 once. Support for 4 is 3/4 = 0.75, which meets the threshold. So {legs count:4} is frequent.
- diet: herbivore appears three times, omnivore once, carnivore once. Support for herbivore is 3/4, which is exactly 0.75. So {diet: herbivore} is frequent. The others are below.
- blood: hot appears in all four, so support is 1.0. {blood: hot} is frequent.
- body hair: yes in all four. {body hair: yes} is frequent.
- eggs: False appears three times, True once. Support for False is 0.75, so {eggs: False} is frequent. {eggs: True} is 0.25, not frequent.
- breastfeeding: indeed in all four. {breastfeeding: indeed} is frequent.

Okay, so the single itemsets that are frequent are:

- legs count:4
- diet: herbivore
- blood: hot
- body hair: yes
- eggs: False
- breastfeeding: indeed

Now, moving on to itemsets of length 2. I'll need to combine each of the above with every other attribute and check support.

Let's start with legs count:4 combined with each of the others.

1. legs count:4 and diet: herbivore. In how many rows do both appear? Only the platypus row has legs count:4 and diet:carnivore, so no rows have both legs count:4 and diet: herbivore. Support is 0.
2. legs count:4 and blood: hot. All rows have legs count:4, and all have blood:hot. So support is 3/4 = 0.75. Frequent.
3. legs count:4 and body hair: yes. All rows with legs count:4 also have body hair: yes. Support 3/4. Frequent.
4. legs count:4 and eggs: False. Only the platypus row has legs count:4 and eggs:True. So no overlap. Support 0.
5. legs count:4 and breastfeeding: indeed. All rows with legs count:4 also have breastfeeding: indeed. Support 3/4. Frequent.

Next, legs count:4 combined with diet: herbivore is 0, so not frequent. Legs count:4 with diet: herbivore is not frequent.

Moving on to legs count:4 combined with blood:hot is frequent, as above.

Legs count:4 combined with body hair: yes is frequent.

Legs count:4 combined with eggs:False is 0.

Legs count:4 combined with breastfeeding: indeed is frequent.

Now, diet: herbivore combined with each:

1. diet: herbivore and blood: hot. All rows with diet: herbivore also have blood:hot. Support 3/4. Frequent.
2. diet: herbivore and body hair: yes. All rows with diet: herbivore also have body hair: yes. Support 3/4. Frequent.
3. diet: herbivore and eggs: False. Only the rabbit and human have diet: herbivore and eggs:False. Support 2/4 = 0.5. Not frequent.
4. diet: herbivore and breastfeeding: indeed. All rows with diet: herbivore also have breastfeeding: indeed. Support 3/4. Frequent.

Next, diet: herbivore with blood:hot, body hair: yes, and breastfeeding: indeed are all frequent.

Diet: herbivore combined with eggs:False is not frequent.

Diet: herbivore combined with legs count:4 is not frequent.

Diet: herbivore combined with body hair: yes is frequent.

Diet: herbivore combined with eggs:False is not frequent.

Diet: herbivore combined with breastfeeding: indeed is frequent.

Blood: hot combined with each:

1. blood: hot and body hair: yes. All rows have both. Support 1. Frequent.
2. blood: hot and eggs: False. Only the rabbit has both. Support 0.25. Not frequent.
3. blood: hot and breastfeeding: indeed. All rows have both. Support 1. Frequent.

Body hair: yes combined with:

1. legs count:4. Support 3/4. Frequent.
2. diet: herbivore. Support 3/4. Frequent.
3. eggs: False. Support 2/4. Not frequent.
4. breastfeeding: indeed. Support 1. Frequent.

Eggs: False combined with:

1. legs count:4. Support 0.
2. diet: herbivore. Support 0 (only rabbit and platypus have eggs:False, but only rabbit has diet: herbivore).
3. blood: hot. Support 1 (only rabbit has eggs:False and blood:hot).
4. body hair: yes. Support 0 (only rabbit and fox have eggs:False, but only rabbit has body hair: yes).
5. breastfeeding: indeed. Support 0.

Breastfeeding: indeed combined with:

1. legs count:4. Support 3/4. Frequent.
2. diet: herbivore. Support 3/4. Frequent.
3. blood: hot. Support 1. Frequent.
4. body hair: yes. Support 1. Frequent.
5. eggs: False. Support 1. Frequent.

Now, let's list all the frequent 2-itemsets:

- legs count:4 and blood: hot
- legs count:4 and body hair: yes
- legs count:4 and breastfeeding: indeed
- diet: herbivore and blood: hot
- diet: herbivore and body hair: yes
- diet: herbivore and breastfeeding: indeed
- blood: hot and body hair: yes
- blood: hot and breastfeeding: indeed
- body hair: yes and legs count:4
- body hair: yes and diet: herbivore
- legs count:4 and eggs: False is not frequent
- legs count:4 and diet: herbivore is not frequent
- legs count:4 and eggs: True is not frequent
- legs count:4 and blood: hot is frequent
- legs count:4 and body hair: yes is frequent
- legs count:4 and breastfeeding: indeed is frequent
- diet: herbivore and blood: hot is frequent
- diet: herbivore and body hair: yes is frequent
- diet: herbivore and breastfeeding: indeed is frequent
- blood: hot and body hair: yes is frequent
- blood: hot and breastfeeding: indeed is frequent
- blood: hot and diet: herbivore is frequent
- body hair: yes and diet: herbivore is frequent
- body hair: yes and legs count:4 is frequent
- body hair: yes and diet: herbivore is frequent
- blood: hot and diet: herbivore is frequent
- blood: hot and eggs: False is not frequent
- blood: hot and body hair: yes is frequent
- blood: hot and breastfeeding: indeed is frequent
- eggs: False and anything is mostly not frequent
- breastfeeding: indeed and anything is mostly frequent

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in listing all combinations. Let me correct that.

The frequent 2-itemsets are:

- legs count:4 and blood: hot
- legs count:4 and body hair: yes
- legs count:4 and breastfeeding: indeed
- diet: herbivore and blood: hot
- diet: herbivore and body hair: yes
- diet: herbivore and breastfeeding: indeed
- blood: hot and body hair: yes
- blood: hot and breastfeeding: indeed
- diet: herbivore and legs count:4 is the same as legs count:4 and diet: herbivore, which is already listed
- blood: hot and legs count:4 is the same as legs count:4 and blood: hot
- blood: hot and diet: herbivore is a separate one
- body hair: yes and legs count:4 is the same as legs count:4 and body hair: yes
- body hair: yes and diet: herbivore is a separate one
- blood: hot and body hair: yes is the same as body hair: yes and blood: hot

So, to avoid duplicates, the unique 2-itemsets are:

1. legs count:4, blood: hot
2. legs count:4, body hair: yes
3. legs count:4, breastfeeding: indeed
4. diet: herbivore, blood: hot
5. diet: herbivore, body hair: yes
6. diet: herbivore, breastfeeding: indeed
7. blood: hot, body hair: yes
8. blood: hot, breastfeeding: indeed
9. diet: herbivore, legs count:4 (duplicate)
10. blood: hot, legs count:4 (duplicate)
11. body hair: yes, legs count:4 (duplicate)
12. diet: herbivore, body hair: yes (duplicate)
13. blood: hot, legs count:4 (duplicate)
14. blood: hot, diet: herbivore (duplicate)
15. body hair: yes, blood: hot (duplicate)
16. body hair: yes, diet: herbivore (duplicate)
17. blood: hot, body hair: yes (duplicate)

So, the unique 2-itemsets are the first 8.

Now, moving on to 3-itemsets. I'll need to combine the 2-itemsets and check support.

Starting with legs count:4, blood: hot, and another attribute.

1. legs count:4, blood: hot, diet: herbivore. Support is the number of rows where all three are present. Only the rabbit row has legs count:4, blood:hot, and diet: herbivore. So support 1/4 = 0.25. Not frequent.
2. legs count:4, blood: hot, body hair: yes. All rows with legs count:4 and blood:hot also have body hair: yes. Support 3/4. Frequent.
3. legs count:4, blood: hot, breastfeeding: indeed. All rows with legs count:4 and blood:hot also have breastfeeding: indeed. Support 3/4. Frequent.
4. legs count:4, body hair: yes, diet: herbivore. Support is same as above, 1/4. Not frequent.
5. legs count:4, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed. Support 3/4. Frequent.
6. legs count:4, breastfeeding: indeed, diet: herbivore. Support 1/4. Not frequent.
7. diet: herbivore, blood: hot, body hair: yes. Support is the same as legs count:4, blood:hot, diet: herbivore, which is 1/4. Not frequent.
8. diet: herbivore, blood: hot, breastfeeding: indeed. Support is same as above, 1/4. Not frequent.
9. diet: herbivore, body hair: yes, legs count:4. Support 1/4. Not frequent.
10. diet: herbivore, body hair: yes, blood: hot. Support 1/4. Not frequent.
11. diet: herbivore, legs count:4, breastfeeding: indeed. Support 1/4. Not frequent.
12. blood: hot, body hair: yes, legs count:4. Support 3/4. Frequent.
13. blood: hot, body hair: yes, diet: herbivore. Support 1/4. Not frequent.
14. blood: hot, legs count:4, breastfeeding: indeed. Support 3/4. Frequent.
15. legs count:4, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed. Support 3/4. Frequent.
16. legs count:4, diet: herbivore, legs count:4 is duplicate
17. legs count:4, blood: hot, legs count:4 is duplicate
18. legs count:4, blood: hot, body hair: yes, and another attribute.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to build upon each 2-itemset and add another attribute.

Starting with legs count:4, blood: hot:

- Add diet: herbivore: support 0.25, not frequent.
- Add body hair: yes: support 3/4, frequent.
- Add breastfeeding: indeed: support 3/4, frequent.

So, from legs count:4, blood: hot, we get two 3-itemsets: legs count:4, blood: hot, body hair: yes and legs count:4, blood: hot, breastfeeding: indeed.

Next, legs count:4, body hair: yes:

- Add diet: herbivore: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add diet: herbivore: same as above.
- Add eggs: False: support 0, not frequent.
- Add breastfeeding: indeed: support 3/4, frequent.

So, legs count:4, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed is frequent.

Next, legs count:4, breastfeeding: indeed:

- Add diet: herbivore: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add diet: herbivore: same.
- Add eggs: False: support 0, not frequent.
- Add diet: herbivore: same.

No new 3-itemsets here.

Next, diet: herbivore, blood: hot:

- Add body hair: yes: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add legs count:4: same as above, legs count:4, diet: herbivore, blood: hot is 0.25, not frequent.
- Add breastfeeding: indeed: support 1/4, not frequent.

No frequent 3-itemsets here.

Next, diet: herbivore, body hair: yes:

- Add legs count:4: same as above, not frequent.
- Add blood: hot: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add breasts: indeed: support 1/4, not frequent.

No frequent 3-itemsets.

Next, diet: herbivore, breastfeeding: indeed:

- Add legs count:4: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add legs count:4: same.
- Add blood: hot: support 1/4, not frequent.

No frequent 3-itemsets.

Next, blood: hot, body hair: yes:

- Add legs count:4: support 3/4, frequent.
- Add legs count:4: same.
- Add diet: herbivore: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add breastfeeding: indeed: support 3/4, frequent.

So, blood: hot, body hair: yes, legs count:4 and blood: hot, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed are frequent.

Next, blood: hot, breastfeeding: indeed:

- Add legs count:4: support 3/4, frequent.
- Add legs count:4: same.
- Add diet: herbivore: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add body hair: yes: support 3/4, frequent.

So, blood: hot, breastfeeding: indeed, legs count:4 and blood: hot, breastfeeding: indeed, body hair: yes are frequent.

Now, legs count:4, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed is frequent.

Moving on, are there any other combinations?

I think we've covered all combinations. So, the frequent 3-itemsets are:

1. legs count:4, blood: hot, body hair: yes
2. legs count:4, blood: hot, breastfeeding: indeed
3. legs count:4, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed
4. blood: hot, body hair: yes, legs count:4
5. blood: hot, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed

Wait, some of these are duplicates in terms of support. Let me list them without duplication:

1. legs count:4, blood: hot, body hair: yes (support 3/4)
2. legs count:4, blood: hot, breastfeeding: indeed (support 3/4)
3. legs count:4, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed (support 3/4)
4. blood: hot, body hair: yes, legs count:4 (support 3/4)
5. blood: hot, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed (support 3/4)

So, these are all the same combinations, just ordered differently. So, essentially, only four unique 3-itemsets.

But in terms of support, each is 3/4, so they are all frequent.

Now, moving on to 4-itemsets. I'll need to add another attribute to each 3-itemset.

Starting with legs count:4, blood: hot, body hair: yes:

- Add diet: herbivore: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add eggs: False: support 0, not frequent.
- Add breastfeeding: indeed: support 4/4 = 1, frequent.

So, legs count:4, blood: hot, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed is a 4-itemset with support 1.

Next, legs count:4, blood: hot, breastfeeding: indeed:

- Add diet: herbivore: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add legs count:4, body hair: yes: support 3/4. Frequent, but already part of another set.
- Add eggs: False: support 0, not frequent.
- Add body hair: yes: same as above.

No new 4-itemsets here.

Next, legs count:4, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed:

- Add diet: herbivore: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add diet: herbivore: same.
- Add eggs: False: support 0, not frequent.
- Add blood: hot: same as above.

No new 4-itemsets.

Next, blood: hot, body hair: yes, legs count:4:

- Add diet: herbivore: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add legs count:4, body hair: yes: same as above.
- Add eggs: False: support 0, not frequent.
- Add breastfeeding: indeed: same as above.

No new 4-itemsets.

Next, blood: hot, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed:

- Add legs count:4: support 3/4, frequent.
- Add diet: herbivore: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add eggs: False: support 0, not frequent.

So, blood: hot, body hair: yes, legs count:4, breastfeeding: indeed is a 4-itemset with support 3/4.

Wait, but we already have legs count:4, blood: hot, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed as the same set.

So, the only 4-itemset is legs count:4, blood: hot, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed, which has support 1.

Now, checking if there are any other 4-itemsets.

I think we've covered all. So, the only 4-itemset is the one with all four attributes: legs count:4, blood: hot, body hair: yes, and breastfeeding: indeed.

Now, moving on to 5-itemsets. We'll need to add another attribute to the 4-itemset.

Starting with legs count:4, blood: hot, body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed:

- Add diet: herbivore: support 1/4, not frequent.
- Add eggs: False: support 0, not frequent.

So, no 5-itemsets.

Thus, the only 5-itemset would be the same as the 4-itemset, but since it's already 4-itemset, we don't go further.

So, summarizing all frequent itemsets:

Length 1:
- legs count:4
- blood: hot
- body hair: yes
- breastfeeding: indeed
- eggs: False

Wait, no. Eggs: False is not frequent. So, only the above four.

Length 2:
- legs count:4, blood: hot
- legs count:4, body hair: yes
- legs count:4, breastfeeding: indeed
- diet: herbivore, blood: hot
- diet: herbivore, body hair: yes
- diet: herbivore, breastfeeding: indeed
- blood: hot, body hair: yes
- blood: hot, breastfeeding: indeed
- body hair: yes, breastfeeding: indeed (but wait, is this a frequent set?)

Wait, body hair: yes and breastfeeding: indeed is a 2-itemset. Let me check its support.

Rows with body hair: yes and breastfeeding: indeed. Only the rabbit and fox have body hair: yes, and only the rabbit has breastfeeding: indeed. So, only
